# README

This is a side project of mine. I'm working on creating a Stack Overflow clone but specifically for the Turing Community.

# What You'll Need
* You'll need to create your own Twilio Programmable Chat `ACCOUNT_SID` , `IPM_SERVICE_ID` , `API_KEY_SECRET`, `API_KEY_SID` for the chat box to work.

### Setup
* Clone down or fork this repo
* Run `rake db: {create, migrate, seed}`
